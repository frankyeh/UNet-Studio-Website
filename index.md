U-Net Studio is a powerful tool that segments brain tissues in human and animal scan data. It uses a unique data augmentation strategy combines visual simulation and negative output saturation to achieve accurate and efficient segmentation with just one training dataset. The training results demonstrate that U-Net Studio is highly adaptive to previously unseen data, accurately segmenting subjects with large lesions. Moreover, U-Net Studio provides highly adaptive models for customizing region segmentation in both humans and animals, including rodents, rhesus monkeys, and marmosets. These pre-trained models are easily adaptable and retrainable for various imaging modalities, streamlining the segmentation process and reducing the need for manual annotation. U-Net Studio represents a valuable tool for improving the analysis of neuroimaging data.
