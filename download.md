## UNet Studio Pre-release

U-Net Studio is a standard alone executive program written in C++. The only dependency is CUDA Toolkit and Libtorch DLLs. To use U-Net Studio, download the zip file from the link and uncompress it to any folder. There is a install_win.bat script to install CUDA Toolkit and Libtorch DLLs. After it finishes, just run the program.

**Currently, only Windows version is available for testing**
